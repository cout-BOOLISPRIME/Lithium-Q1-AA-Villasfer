                At present, the human race has become increasingly dependent on technology to the point where we are
                often
                at its mercy. From daily tasks like waking up needing our phones, to simply passing the time with social
                media, as well as using our gadgets for school, work, and entertainment. This massive dependence creates
                a
                loop where we are just purely dependent on technology itself. Technology was created to serve humans,
                but
                the ongoing trend seems to show that humans are the slaves, and technology is the master, giving it not
                just
                our time, but also our efforts and attention.
            </div>

            <div id="para2">
                In addition, this dependence on technology can also affect us in our relationships. Some people spend
                hours
                on their phone instead of actually talking to somebody face-to-face, while some struggle being offline
                even
                for just a short moment. So in a way, this tool that was made to make our lives easier may also make
                them
                worse in a lot of ways. Although technology has a lot of benefits, sometimes, we need to actually think
                about the drawbacks. Otherwise, we risk being reliant on it like slaves, rather than using it for
                something
                better.
