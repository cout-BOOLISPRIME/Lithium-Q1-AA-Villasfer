                A messenger of the current relationship between technology and humans. Where my goal is to open the eyes
                of
                the people and let them see what truly is happening. My reason to do so is due to my personal experience
                as
                well, knowing well how hard and enslaving technology is, making it so easy to follow the facade of
                technology, making you believe that you will have relaxation and time-management, when in reality it’s
                just
                laziness in the disguise of something productive. Making the common person most likely to be reliant on
                technology, instead of doing the work themselves.


                Rough information: A high school student who likes coding. 5’7 height and likes Arctic Monkeys and their
                song, “Do I wanna know?”. A Pisay scholar who is struggling with physics and wants to choke their
                teacher to death. Forced to do this for the grades and whatnot.
