            Human dependency on technology is the dominant sort such that individuals can usually not live without the
            internet. A good example of this is a psychological disorder called nomophobia, where individuals under its
            influence get anxious in the absence of their phone. This is highly important because, for example, how
            would you react if you suddenly lost your phone? Wouldn't you feel anxious and disturbed after finding out
            that? Would not you desperately search for your previous phone, no matter its cost, concentrating on your
            dependency on it, as if the phone is your existence? That is how most people probably think about the
            current dependency of humans on technology, as the servants of technology.

            So, why is it socially relevant? Mainly because most people cannot really "function" without some
            technology. For example, using your phone to search for a topic like viruses. If I don't have a phone, I
            don't really see them finding that information so readily, and I don't see them thinking to go to the town
            library like they would have before. In addition, if a business wants to spread information to its branches,
            it would be more challenging without using letters or going to that particular branch. Rather than just
            depending on technology to forward an email to the branch manager.
